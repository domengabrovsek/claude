# Expert Agent Routing

**When to apply:** a task touches a specialized domain. Skip for typos, one-liners, and config tweaks.

Spawn a teammate via the Agent tool with the matching `subagent_type`. It loads the persona in its own context and returns a summary.

- Never read `agents/*.md` into the main conversation. That pollutes context and bleeds the persona's bias into unrelated work later in the session `(review-time: file-access decision, not a code pattern)`
- Act on the teammate's summary, not on the persona file `(review-time: about how the reply gets used)`
- Teammates may disagree. Surface the conflict to the user rather than silently picking a side `(review-time: requires reading several teammate outputs)`
- A task crossing domains spawns its teammates in parallel, in one message `(review-time: requires recognizing the cross-domain shape)`

| `PR Reviewer` | Pull request review, code review |
| `Cybersecurity Expert` | Security review, OWASP, auth flows, vulnerability assessment |
| `PostgreSQL Expert` | SQL, indexes, query plans, migrations, schema design |
| `AWS Expert` | AWS services and infrastructure |
| `GCP Expert` | GCP services and infrastructure |
| `Networking Expert` | DNS, TCP, load balancers, CDN, VPN |
