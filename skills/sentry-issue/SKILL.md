name: sentry-issue
description: Fetch and digest Sentry issue data (issue summary, tags, stack trace, breadcrumbs, latest event) by short ID, numeric issue ID, or sentry.io URL. Org-agnostic - works for any Sentry org the local token can access. Use when the user mentions a Sentry issue or short ID (e.g. MY-PROJECT-4X2), pastes a sentry.io issue URL, or asks to investigate/debug a Sentry error.

# Sentry Issue Investigation

Pull everything needed to debug a Sentry issue, starting from just a short ID.

## Quick start

```bash
~/.claude/skills/sentry-issue/scripts/sentry-issue.sh MY-PROJECT-4X2
```

Accepts a short ID (`PROJECT-ABC`), a numeric issue ID, or a full issue URL
(`https://<org>.sentry.io/issues/123456/`). Prints a compact digest:
issue summary, tags, exception chain with in-app stack frames, request info,
last 10 breadcrumbs. Full JSON payloads are saved to
`/tmp/sentry-issue-<id>.json` and `/tmp/sentry-event-<id>.json` for follow-up
`jq` queries.

## How auth and org resolution work

- **Token**: `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` env -> `./.sentryclirc` -> repo-root
  `.sentryclirc` -> `~/.sentryclirc`. The token is never printed.
- **Org**: `--org <slug>` flag -> `SENTRY_ORG` env -> `.sentryclirc`
  `org` key -> auto-discovery via `GET /api/0/organizations/`. With a single
  accessible org it is used directly; with multiple orgs, short IDs are probed
  against each, while numeric IDs require `--org`.
- **Server**: `SENTRY_URL` env or `.sentryclirc` `url` key for self-hosted;
  defaults to `https://sentry.io` (which proxies org-scoped routes to the
  correct region, including EU orgs).

Required token scopes: `org:read`, `project:read`, `event:read`.

## Investigation workflow

1. Run the script with the identifier the user gave.
2. Read the digest: in-app frames (`[app]` prefix) point at the failing code;
   tags like `functionName`, `transaction`, `url`, `environment` locate the
   runtime context.
3. Open the implicated source files in the matching repo and trace the failure
   path. The Sentry project slug usually maps to a repo - check the slug
   against the repos you have locally.
4. For deeper context, query the saved JSON, e.g.:

   ```bash
   jq '.entries[] | select(.type=="exception") | .data.values[0].stacktrace.frames[] | select(.inApp) | {filename, lineNo, context}' /tmp/sentry-event-<id>.json
   jq '{stats: .stats, firstRelease: .firstRelease.version, lastRelease: .lastRelease.version}' /tmp/sentry-issue-<id>.json
   jq '.contexts' /tmp/sentry-event-<id>.json
   ```

5. For a structured root-cause investigation, continue with the `/debug`
   workflow using the gathered evidence.

## Going deeper

See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for the full endpoint map and payload
anatomy: other events (oldest, by ID, walking `previousEventID`/`nextEventID`),
tag value distributions, attachments, issue search, source-context jq recipes,
and what is NOT available (frame-local variables, session replay). Use it
whenever the latest-event digest is not enough evidence.

- For ad-hoc API calls beyond the script, resolve the token the same way the
  script does (inside command substitution) so it never appears in output
  `(review-time: secret handling depends on how the command is composed - not pattern-matchable by a hook)`

## Troubleshooting

- **HTTP 403**: wrong org slug or token lacks scopes - run `sentry-cli info`
  to inspect scopes (never print the token itself).
- **HTTP 404 on short ID**: short ID belongs to a different org - pass
  `--org`, or the issue was deleted.
- **`sentry-cli organizations list` JSON parse error**: known CLI 3.5.0 bug;
  the script's API-based discovery avoids it.
